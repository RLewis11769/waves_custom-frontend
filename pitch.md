# 'Waves'

When I think of "waves" I think of the ocean... But yours is a local company and Tulsa doesn't have an ocean. So what could it be? A kayak rental? A waterpark? Something to do with Tulsa's beautiful Arkansas River?

But no.

When I think of waves in Tulsa, there's only one choice.

El Rio Vista Recording Studio. Our very own internationally-recognized, award-winning soundwave production center. The master of music. The superman of sound. The one and only wizard of waves.

## Design

First, El Rio Vista is cool and sophisticated but fun, so the color palette needed to reflect that. I went with a default dark mode using a dark green-blue and a navy blue. Pops of color were added with a bright aqua and white with undertones of aqua. The color scheme, which evokes rivers and waves, but also comfort, mystery, and a subtle playfulness, is meant to capture El Rio Vista's atmosphere.

The mature but bold color scheme is continued in the black-and-white images chosen. Rather than marketing the spaces and studio rooms where the artists will work in actuality, the images chosen will again reflect the personality of El Rio Vista. In fact, the only places that deviate from the four-color palette listed above are the album covers sprinkled throughout. This makes the music the attention-grabbing highlight of the page as it should be.

In keeping with the minimalist theme, I felt it neccessary to keep the individual sections short and to the point. The "services" section on the homepage for instance, lists only what El Rio Vista offers to clients. No superfluous explanations are necessary. The "results" section details the purpose of the section — the impressive artists who have found El Rio Vista "unique" in the past — and then jumps straight into a slideshow listing them.

This clean design continues into the header and footer, tying each page together. The homepage header section boasts a slideshow of minimalist black-and-white photographs from the studio while the subpages keep the same basic design but amp up the sleekness with solid colors. All text is easily-readable and the icons in the footer clearly hint at what the links' destinations.
