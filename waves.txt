When I think of "waves" I think of the ocean... But yours is a local company and Tulsa doesn't have an ocean. So what could it be? A kayak rental? A waterpark? Something to do with Tulsa's beautiful Arkansas River?

But no.

When I think of waves in Tulsa, there's only one choice.

El Rio Vista Recording Studio. Our very own internationally-recognized, award-winning soundwave production center. The master of music. The superman of sound. The one and only wizard of waves.

For a company like El Rio Vista, I knew I needed to step up my game.

First, El Rio Vista is cool and sophisticated but fun, so the color palette needed to reflect that. I went with a default dark mode using a dark green-blue and a navy blue. Pops of color were added with a bright aqua and white with undertones of aqua. The color scheme, which evokes rivers and waves, but also comfort, mystery, and a subtle playfulness, is meant to capture El Rio Vista's atmosphere.

The mature but bold color scheme is continued in the black-and-white images chosen. Rather than marketing the spaces and studio rooms where the artists will work in actuality, the images chosen will again reflect the personality of El Rio Vista. In fact, the only places that deviate from the four-color palette listed above are the album covers sprinkled throughout. This makes the music the attention-grabbing highlight of the page as it should be.
