# Waves - Custom Frontend From Scratch

## Project Info

You and your team have been contacted by a local, elusive, client. They have a new product and they need a responsive website built for them in order to market it online; they know youâ€™ve got just the right skill set to craft their vision. Secretive as they are, they have decided to NOT give you details about their company, nor give you details on the product they are selling. Instead, they hand over to you a simple sentence, which they want you to interpret, in order to build the best possible responsive website for them to use as a marketing tool. The sentence they give you is:

"Waves"

You and your team are tasked with the following:

- Build a 1-3 page website for the product you believe they are selling based on their prompt
- Your website must be locally hosted
- Your website must integrate at least 3 of the following components:
	- CSS Framework(s) (e.g. Bootstrap, Semantic UI, etc.)
	- JavaScript framework(s)
	- Utilizing a third-party API
	- A backend with a storage system
	- CSS Preprocessor
	- Accessibility
	- Cookies
	- Forms
